For many years, the <a target="_blank" href="http://llk.media.mit.edu">Lifelong Kindergarten group</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, led by <a target="_blank" href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/">Mitch Resnick</a>, has been developing new technologies, activities, and environments (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/">Computer Clubhouses</a>) to engage all children, from all backgrounds, in creative learning experiences.
 
[Learning Creative Learning]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.html %}) (LCL) is our effort to connect and share ideas with people around the world with similar goals, visions, and values. It is an opportunity for like-minded educators and learners to meet one another and share ideas, strategies, and practical tips on how to support creative learning.

LCL is organized as a six-week online course, but its real goal is to cultivate an ongoing learning community in support of creative learning around the world.

Each week we will offer online videos, readings, and hands-on activities. You’ll be able go through this material at your own pace. All of our materials will be freely available (including sections from Mitch Resnick’s new <a target="_blank" href="http://lifelongkindergarten.net/">Lifelong Kindergarten book</a>). You can spend as much or as little time you like -- by watching, reading, making, sharing, reflecting, and discussing.
