								<p>WeScratch is an experiment! We are tinkering with the tools and the format of the workshops, and we’d love feedback and ideas from participants who will play with us!</p>

						<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3 text-center"><strong>What does a session look like?</strong></h4>
						<p> WeScratch workshops will be hosted on <a href="https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/">Unhangout<a>, an open source online platform for running participant-driven online learning events.</p>
						<p>Every session will follow the “Imagine, Create, Share” structure:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Imagine</strong>: We will start with a quick demonstration of things you can make with Scratch, to show possibilities and spark imagination.</li>
								<li><strong>Create</strong>: Then, you will work on your own Scratch project, eventually sharing your screen and video-chatting with a facilitator and other participants in small groups.</li>
								<li><strong>Share</strong>: Finally, everyone will have the opportunity to share their project. At the end of the session, we’ll spend some time to reflect about the experience and get feedback for next iterations.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>


						<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-center"><strong>What do I need to participate?</strong></h4>
						<p>All you need is an Internet connection and a computer (no tablets) that you can use to make a video-call (i.e. with a webcam, microphone, and speakers or headphones). You will need to create an account on Scratch, one on Unhangout, and also install a free browser extension to share your screen with others — find  out how in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rw3Rp6ty97SJ-peyFfsT86UNC4tT818y1htUXdV0naA/edit?usp=sharing">step-by-step guide</a>.</p>

						<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-center"><strong>What happens when I sign up?</strong></h4>
						<p>In the <a href="http://eepurl.com/geeAxD">signup form</a> you'll be able to choose which date / time works best for you. Once you are registered, you’ll receive more information on how to get ready for the session.</p>
						<p>Even if none of the current session times work for you, please use the registration form to let us know if you want to be notified about future sessions, and feel free to suggest days / times that would work better for you.</p>

						<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-center"><strong>When are the next workshops happening?</strong></h4>
