  Read Seymour Papert’s essay on Gears of My Childhood and write a short description of an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you.

  For inspiration, here are some childhood-object stories that others have written:Cello, Knots, Stars, Blocks, Steps, Coloring Set, Kites, Pencils. (Most of these stories are from Sherry Turkle’s books Evocative Objects (2007) and Falling for Science (2008). Also, see Sherry Turkle’s Introduction about evocative childhood objects.)
