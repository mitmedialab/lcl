    discussion-prompt: |

      Think about the ideas of this week and share your thoughts with others, using the discussion forum and/or talking with your friends and colleagues in person if you are hosting a local meet-up.
      
      We invite you to start reflecting by picking one of the P's (Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play) and explaining why it is particularly important for you.
      
      * Which one is your favorite P - and why? 
      (Don't take this questions too seriously, we know all of them are important!)

      Other ways to reflect this week could include a discussion about A and X students, imagining the kindergarten approach in your learning environment, or sharing a favorite quote from the week's readings and explaining why it resonates with you.
      
      Ask your own questions, reply to other people's and start new conversations. We'd love to hear your ideas!
