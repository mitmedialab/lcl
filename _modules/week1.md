    discussion-prompt: |

      Choose one (or more) of the prompts and share your thoughts with others. 
      You can do it in the discussion forum and/or talk with your friends and colleagues in person if you are hosting a local meet-up.
      
      Here are some ideas:
      
      * [Play with the P's](http://lcl-discuss.media.mit.edu) - Which one is your favorite P and why? (Don't take this questions too seriously, we know all of them are important!)

      * [Lifelong Kindergarten approach](http://lcl-discuss.media.mit.edu) - Imagine if your learning environment was more similar to a kindergarten. What would be exciting? What would you be worried about?
      
      * [Quotes](http://lcl-discuss.media.mit.edu) - Share a quote from one of this week's readings (or video) that particularly resonated with you. Why did you choose it?
