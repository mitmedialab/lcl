    title: Reflection prompts
    discussion-prompt: |
      Here are some ideas on how to reflect on this week's topics:

      * Play with the P's - Which one is your favorite P and why? How would you rank them, and why? (Don't take this questions too seriously, we know all of them are important! :)
      * Lifelong Kindergarten approach - Imagine if all of school was more similar to a kindergarten. What would be exciting? What are your concerns?
      * Quotes - Post a sentence from one of this week's readings that particularly resonated with you. Why did you choose it?
      Choose one (or more!) of the prompts and share your thoughts with others. You can click on the links to access the forum, or discuss with your friends and colleagues in person if you are hosting a meet-up.
