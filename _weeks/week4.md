  activity-desc: |
    This week we invite you to create a remix! 
    Choose one of the projects shared on LCL in the past few weeks (or any other project that inspires you) and create your own version of it. 
    You can remix anything: it can be something physical, a poem, a recipe, or a Scratch project!

    Share your remix in the forum and thank the author of the original project. What inspired you about the original project? What did you change and why? If one of your projects was remixed, how did it feel?
