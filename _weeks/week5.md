    This week we encourage you to take time to tinker with something:
 
    * Choose a material or technology to playfully experiment with
    * Describe and share a picture or video of what you were tinkering with
    * Reflect on your tinkering process
 
    What were you tinkering with? Did you try anything new or different? What did you notice? What might you want to try next?

      In this week’s video and readings, Mitch uses Marina Bers’ metaphors of “playpen” and “playground” to illustrate that “not all types of play are created equal”.

      What do you think? What does play look like in your practice? What are some of the design choices or facilitation strategies that you already use, or you plan to use, to promote a playground-style play?
