      This week we want to highlight different ideas around Projects.

      Pick one (or more) of this reflection prompts and share your ideas in the discussion forum:
      * [Projects in Scratch](https://aaa.com) - Projects are the basic unit of making in Scratch. What differences do you see with other approaches? How has you experience with Scratch changed the way you think about coding?
      * [Projects into your Practice](https://aaa.com) - Learning through making projects doesn't apply only to coding. What challenges do you see in supporting this P in your practice? What opportunities? What questions do you have?
      * [Creative Learning Spiral](https://aaa.com) - The Creative Learning Spiral is a model to help us thinking about the creative process. How would you describe or draw your creative learning process? How would you remix the spiral?
