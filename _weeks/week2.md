  activity-title: Make Something!
  activity-overview: |

  activity-desc: |
    This week we invite you to make a project and share your process with the community!

    You can make something:
    - very big, very small, green, sweet, loud, unusual, ...
    - in your kitchen, in a makerspace, outside ...
    - with paper, with wood, with Scratch, ...
    - for yourself, for someone else, for work, for fun, ...

    It can be something you do only for this week, or a piece of a bigger project you'd like to work on.

    When you are ready, share your project (picture, link, and/or description) and reflect on your process. Some questions to possibly consider as you reflect: How did you get the idea? What was a challenge you encountered? What would you do if you had more time?
