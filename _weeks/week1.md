  activity-title: Childhood Object
  activity-overview: |
    This week we invite you to share a childhood object with the community.
    In the following video, Lily and Shruti explain a little bit more (subtitles available in multiple languages)

  activity-desc: |

    This week we invite you to <strong>share a childhood object</strong> with the community.<br/>
    It is a concrete way to reflect on our own learning, and to start building our community by creating personal and emotional connections.

    In this activity you will:

    1. Read Seymour Papert’s essay on [Gears of My Childhood]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.pdf?pdf=gears.en) (also available in [Italiano]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.it.pdf?pdf=gears.it), [Português]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.pt.pdf?pdf=gears.pt), [Español]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.es.pdf?pdf=gears.es), [日本語]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.ja.pdf?pdf=gears.ja)). 

    2. Think about an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you.

    3. Share a photo and a short reflection about your object. What was special about it? <strong>How did it affect the way you think and learn?</strong>

    discussion-prompt: |

      This week we are going to reflect on the core ideas of Creative Learning by playing with the 4P's.

      We'd love to hear:

      <p class="ml-4"><strong>Which one among the 4P's (Projects, Passion, Peers and Play) are you particularly curious or excited about, and why?</strong></p>

      Feel free to start new conversations and play with other ideas: for example imagining the kindergarten approach in your learning environment, or sharing a favorite quote from the week's readings and explaining why it resonates with you.
