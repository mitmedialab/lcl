  forum-button-text: Share Your Object

  activity-title: Childhood Object
  activity-overview: |
    This week we invite you to share a childhood object with the community.
    In the following video, Lily and Shruti explain a little bit more (subtitles available in multiple languages)

  activity-desc: |
    Here are the steps for this activity

    1. Read Seymour Papert’s essay on [Gears of My Childhood]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears-v1.pdf) 
    <br/><i class="fa fa-globe mr-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> also available in [Italiano (Italian)]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears-v1.it.pdf), [日本語 (Japanese)]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears-v1.ja.pdf), [Português (Portuguese)]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears-v1.pt.pdf), [Español (Spanish)]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears-v1.es.pdf)
    
    2. Think about an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you. What was special about it? How did it affect the way you think and learn?
    
    3. Go to the [discussion forum](http://lcl-discuss.media.mit.edu) to see other people's objects
    
    4. Share a photo and short description of your childhood object

    discussion-prompt: |

      This week we are going to reflect on the core ideas of Creative Learning by playing with the 4P's.

      We'd love to hear:

      <p class="ml-4"><strong>Which one among the 4P's (Projects, Passion, Peers and Play) are you particularly curious or excited about, and why?</strong></p>

      Feel free to start new conversations and play with other ideas: for example imagining the kindergarten approach in your learning environment, or sharing a favorite quote from the week's readings and explaining why it resonates with you.
