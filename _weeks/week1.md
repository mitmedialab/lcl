  activity-title: Childhood Object
  activity-overview: |
    This week we invite you to share a childhood object with the community.
    In the following video, Lily and Shruti explain a little bit more (subtitles available in multiple languages)

  activity-desc: |

    This week we invite you to <strong>share one of your childhood objects</strong> with other people.<br/>
    Objects provide a concrete way for thinking and reflecting on our own learning. <br/>
    Also, it's a playful way to share something about us, creating personal and emotional connections.

    In this activity you will:

    1. Read Seymour Papert’s essay on [Gears of My Childhood]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.pdf?pdf=gears.en) (also available in [Italiano]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.it.pdf?pdf=gears.it), [Português]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.pt.pdf?pdf=gears.pt), [Español]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.es.pdf?pdf=gears.es), [日本語]( ../../resources/activity/week1/gears.ja.pdf?pdf=gears.ja)). 

    2. Think about an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you.

    3. Share a photo and a short reflection about your object. What was special about it? How did it affect the way you think and learn?

      <strong>What is Your Fifth P?</strong><br/>
      We take Creative Learning seriously, that's why we like to play, also with the P's!

      In this course we'll explore learning through Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play. </br>
      What is another word that Creative Learning evokes for you? It can start with a P, or with any letter! :) <br/>
      Share your thoughs in the forum (or in the experimental <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/lcl-community/shared_invite/enQtNDQ1MDI5NDkzOTc0LWMyZmQ2Yjg5ZDViZTI1MWQ2ZjE4ZmE3NmMzNjdlYzY5Y2MzYmQ4YTA4YjI2ZWZjNTVlYmVkNjUwM2IyNDc4ZDk">Slack channel</a>)
