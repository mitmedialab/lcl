  activity-desc: |

    This week we invite you to explore Scratch by making a project about something or someone you care about. For example, it can be an animation about one of your favorite hobbies, books, or places, a video game featuring your pet, or a greeting card for someone you love!

    When you feel ready, share your project and your reflections: What motivated you in creating your project? Can you describe a moment of joy or frustration? What helped you persist in face of challenges?

      In this week’s video and readings, Mitch introduces the idea of “wide walls”: designing learning experiences where people can create a variety of different projects in a variety of ways, based on their interests and styles.

      What do the wide walls look like in your practice? What are some of the design choices or facilitation strategies that you already use, or you plan to use to widen the walls?
