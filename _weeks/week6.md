    **Give P's a chance**

    We hope that the ideas we explored together in LCL can help everyone see learning in new ways, and provide a useful framework to approach learning - and other aspects of your life!
 
    That’s why in this last activity of the LCL journey we invite you to share: 
    <br/>**How might you use (or have you used) the four P’s in your practice?**

      For our last week, we invite to you to put the ideas of this course into practice, by sharing an idea or a plan for a project you want to work on, for your students or for yourself, building on ideas you learned or explored in this course.


      In this video, Jaleesa and Sean explain more and give examples.

      **"I used to think ... but now I think ..."**

      We are curious to know how your ideas have evolved, based on the activities and discussions in Learning Creative Learning.
      One way to reflect on your LCL journey is to fill in this sentence:
      I used to think ... , but now I think ...
      What in your journey contributed to the shift in your thinking? How might it influence your work?
